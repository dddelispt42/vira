**Vim JIRA Atlassian**

Stay inside vim while following and updating Jira issues along with creating new issues on the go.

## Installation

Example of vim-plug post-update hook to automatically install python dependencies along with vira:

```
Plug 'n0v1c3/vira', { 'do': './install.sh' }
```

Alternatively, manually install the python3 dependencies:

```
pip install --user jira
```

If you would like to be on board with the active development the `dev` branch can be used:

```
Plug 'n0v1c3/vira', { 'do': './install.sh', 'branch': 'dev' }
```

## Configuration

### Jira servers (required)

The configuration for your jira server(s) needs to be done in a json or yaml file.
The default file-type is json, because it comes with the python standard library.
The default file location is `~/.config/vira/vira_servers.json`.

The following is an example of a typical `vira_servers.json` configuration:

```json
{
  "https://n0v1c3.atlassian.net": {
    "username": "user1",
    "password_cmd": "lpass show --password account",
    "skip_cert_verify": true
  },
  "https://jira.career.com": {
    "username": "user2",
    "password": "SuperSecretPassword"
  }
}
```

For each jira server, the following configuration variables are available:

- `username` - Jira server username.
- `password_cmd` - Run a CLI password manager such as `pass` or `lpass` to retrieve the jira server password.
- `password` - Enter jira server password in plain text. This is not recommended for security reasons, but we're not going to tell you how to live your life.
- `skip_cert_verify` - This option can be set in order to connect to a sever that is using self-signed TLS certificates.

If you can bear to install one additional python pip dependency, `PyYAML`, you can configure your settings in yaml:

```yaml
https://n0v1c3.atlassian.net:
  username: user1
  password_cmd: lpass show --password account
  skip_cert_verify: true
https://jira.career.com:
  username: user2
  password: SuperSecretPassword
```

In order for vira to use the previous yaml example, set the following variable in your .vimrc:
`let g:vira_config_file_servers = $HOME.'/vira_servers.yaml'`

If **no** configuration is found you will be asked for a manual URL, username, and password entry.

#### Atlassian Cloud Notes

[Atlassian Cloud Jira Key](https://id.atlassian.com/manage-profile/security/api-tokens)
may be required if you are using the Atlassian Cloud service.
Create an `API token` and use set it the value of the `password` in your `vira_servers.json` file.

### Quick Start

- Configure `~/.config/vira/vira_servers.json` as per [Jira servers](#jira-servers-required).
- Run `:ViraServers` and press `<cr>` to select server.
- Run `:ViraIssues` and press `<cr>` to select issue.
- Run `:ViraReport` to view report.
- Press `<cr>` to edit any field.
- Rejoice because you have one less reason to leave vim.

### Jira projects

The configuration for your jira project(s) needs to be done in a json or yaml file.
Similar to jira servers, default file file-type is json. The default file location is `~/.config/vira/vira_projects.json`.

When you're in a git repo, vira will auto-load your pre-defined settings by matching the local repo name from file path.

For each jira project, set:

- `server` - The jira server to connect to (using authentication details from `vira_servers.json/yaml`).

The following is an example of a typical `vira_projects.json` configuration:

```json
{
  "vira": {
    "server": "https://n0v1c3.atlassian.net"
  },
  "OtherProject": {
    "server": "https://jira.career.com"
  }
}
```

The following is an example of the same configuration in yaml:

```yaml
vira:
  server: https://n0v1c3.atlassian.net
OtherProject:
  server: https://jira.career.com
```

In order for vira to use the previous yaml example, set the following variable in your .vimrc:
`let g:vira_config_file_projects = $HOME.'/vira_projects.yaml'`.

Note: Vira will only load the vira_projects.json/yaml configuration automatically once per vim session. You can, however, manually switch servers and filters as many times as you want after that. See Usage section.

#### Filters

Default repo filters can be defined under a `filter` key as such:

```yaml
vira:
  server: https://n0v1c3.atlassian.net
  filter:
    project: VIRA
    assignee: mike
    priority: [High, Highest]
    fixVersion: [1.1.1, 1.1.2]
OtherProject:
  server: https://jira.career.com
  filter:
    project: MAIN
    assignee: travis
    status: In-Progress
```

The acceptable values for the filter key are:

- `project` - Filter these projects. Can be a single item or list.
- `assignee` - Filter these assignees. Can be a single item or list.
- `component` - Filter these components. Can be a single item or list.
- `epic` - Filter these epics. Can be a single item or list.
- `fixVersion` - Filter these versions. Can be a single item or list.
- `issuetype` - Filter these issuetypes. Can be a single item or list.
- `priority` - Filter these priorities. Can be a single item or list.
- `reporter` - Filter these reporters. Can be a single item or list.
- `status` - Filter these statuses. Can be a single item or list.

_NOTE:_ `currentUser` is also connected to the active account and can be used for all user related tasks.

#### New Issues

Similar to the `filter` key, you can define a `newissue` key to set repo-based.
default configuration for the new-issue fields, for example:

```yaml
vira:
  server: https://n0v1c3.atlassian.net
  newissue:
    issuetype: Task
OtherProject:
  server: https://jira.career.com
  newissue:
    assignee: travis
  filter:
    assignee: travis
    status: In-Progress
```

The acceptable values for filter keys are:

- `assignee` - Define assignee.
- `component` - Define component. Note - these are project specific.
- `epic` - Define epic. Current project filters apply to list.
- `fixVersion` - Define fixVersion. Note - these are project specific.
- `issuetype` - Define issue type. The default is Bug.
- `priority` - Define priority.
- `status` - Define status. Vira will transition issue to this status.

#### Issue sort order

Optionally, it is possible to define a custom sort order for the issues displayed in `vira_menu`. This sort order is project based - meaning you can define different sort orders for your projects.

Define the sort order using the `issuesort` key as follows:

```yaml
vira:
  server: https://n0v1c3.atlassian.net
  issuesort: status
OtherProject:
  server: https://jira.career.com
  filter:
    assignee: travis
    status: In-Progress
  issuesort:
    - status ASC
    - updated DESC
```

The value of `issuesort` can either be a string or a list.
If no `issuesort` key is provided, the default sort order used is `updated DESC`.

Note that it is possible to define a custom status order in Jira-web in Administration > Issues > Statuses. This can be used to achieve a similar functionality to kanban boards.

#### Project Templates

Templates can be defined in the same way that projects are defined. These templates can be referenced for multiple projects, by using the template key.
Any name can be used for a template, but it is recommended to use the pythonic syntax of `__name__` in order to make a distinction from a project.
Refer to the yaml example below, note that the priority in `repo2` will override the `__maintemplate__` priority:

```yaml
__maintemplate__:
  server: https://n0v1c3.atlassian.net
  filter:
    project: VIRA
    assignee: travis
    priority: [High, Highest]
repo1:
  template: __maintemplate__
repo2:
  template: __maintemplate__
  filter:
    priority: High
```

#### Default Project Template

If you would like to have a catch-all project configuration template, define a `__default__` key in your vira_projects.json/yaml file. Refer to the yaml example below:

```yaml
__default__:
  server: https://n0v1c3.atlassian.net
  filter:
    assignee: mike
  newissue:
    issuetype: Task
```

### Browser

By default, the `open` or `xdg-open` command will be used by `:ViraBrowse` to open the current issue in the default
browser. If either command is missing or you wish to override the default browser, you may set the `g:vira_browser`
variable or provide the `BROWSER` environment variable.

Example setting **custom** default browser using `g:vira_browser`:

```
let g:vira_browser = 'chromium'
```

## Usage

A list of the important commands, functions and global variables to be used to help configure Vira to work for you.

### Keyboard

It is possible to _select multiple_ items from all menus, if nothing is selected prior to the item will be selected from the current column.

_NOTE:_ `currentUser` is also connected to the active account and can be used for all user related tasks.

#### New Issues

Similar to the `filter` key, you can define a `newissue` key to set repo-based.
default configuration for the new-issue fields, see example:

```yaml
vira:
  server: https://n0v1c3.atlassian.net
  newissue:
    issuetype: Task
OtherProject:
  server: https://jira.career.com
  newissue:
    assignee: travis
  filter:
    assignee: travis
    status: In-Progress
```

The acceptable values for filter keys are:

- `assignee` - Define assignee.
- `component` - Define component. Note - these are project specific.
- `epic` - Define epic. Current project filters apply to list.
- `fixVersion` - Define fixVersion. Note - these are project specific.
- `issuetype` - Define issue type. The default is Bug.
- `priority` - Define priority.
- `status` - Define status. Vira will transition issue to this status.

#### Project Templates

Templates can be defined in the same way that projects are defined. These templates can be referenced for multiple projects, by using the template key.
Any name can be used for a template, but it is recommended to use the pythonic syntax of `__name__` in order to make a distinction from a project.
Refer to the yaml example below, note that the priority in `repo2` will override the `__maintemplate__` priority:

```yaml
__maintemplate__:
  server: https://n0v1c3.atlassian.net
  filter:
    project: VIRA
    assignee: travis
    priority: [High, Highest]
repo1:
  template: __maintemplate__
repo2:
  template: __maintemplate__
  filter:
    priority: High
```

#### Default Project Template

If you would like to have a catch-all project configuration template, define a `__default__` key in your vira_projects.json/yaml file. Refer to the yaml example below:

```yaml
__default__:
  server: https://n0v1c3.atlassian.net
  filter:
    assignee: mike
  newissue:
    issuetype: Task
```

### Browser

By default, the `open` or `xdg-open` command will be used by `:ViraBrowse` to open the current issue in the default
browser. If either command is missing or you wish to override the default browser, you may set the `g:vira_browser`
variable or provide the `BROWSER` environment variable.

Example setting **custom** default browser using `g:vira_browser`:

```
let g:vira_browser = 'chromium'
```

Summary
Edit any jira field

Description
A user should be able to edit any field that
is shown on a vira issuereport.

I would suggest to use a default key of <cr>
for editing a report field and allow the user
to customize this mapping.

The edit command would bring up the vira_prompt
buffer, in the same manner as creating new
issues/comments.

Comments
...
```

Most issue fields can be edited by pressing `<cr>`.

For the text entry fields (Summary, Description, Comments), if the text entry is left blank,
the write action will be aborted.

## Troubleshooting/Tips

### Report edits are slow

If you are experiencing laggy report Set/Edits, you are not alone.

There is a bug in the pycontribs/jira library:
[Issue 622](https://github.com/pycontribs/jira/issues/622)

We are working on coming up with a permanent solution to this problem. In the meantime, you can patch your own
version of pycontribs/jira in the following manner.

Comment line 297 in `~/.local/lib/python3.8/site-packages/jira/resources.py`:

```
time.sleep(4)
```

Please note that the jira python library may be in a different location on your machine.

## Support

### Private and Cloud Jira Hosting

We currently support Private Jira servers version 8 and up. We
have not seen issues with the lower versions we had access to
but we no longer do have a test platform.

The Cloud feature now available from Atlassian is currently
also available. The `API token` key referenced above is required
to use as your `password`.

### Vim Plugins

Plugins may be used and supported. This list will build as required from other requests.
Support will be focused on providing functions that provide information along with the related Jira commands for easy usage.

Below are a few common examples.
Please recommend any other tools that could use some good features to make your development easier.

#### vim-fugitive

A simple example is below but recommended that it can be expanded on for your personal needs.

```
function! s:Vira_GitActiveIssue()
    let g:vira_active_issue = execute("Git branch --show-current > echo")
    ViraReport
endfunction

function! s:Vira_GitPrompt()
  return '"' . ViraStatusLine() . ': ' . input(ViraStatusLine() . ': ') . '"'
endfunction

nnoremap <silent> <leader>vgC :execute 'Git checkout -b' . ViraStatusLine()<cr>
nnoremap <silent> <leader>vgc :execute 'Git checkout ' . ViraStatusLine()<cr>
nnoremap <silent> <leader>vgc :execute 'Git commit -m ' . s:Vira_GitPrompt()<cr>
nnoremap <silent> <leader>vgi :call Vira_GitActiveIssue()<cr>
nnoremap <silent> <leader>vgm :execute 'Gmerge --no-ff ' . ViraStatusLine() . ' -m ' . s:Vira_GitPrompt()<cr>
nnoremap <silent> <leader>vgp :execute 'Git push -u origin ' . ViraStatusLine()<cr>
```

#### airline

I am currently using the z section of airline until I figure out the proper way to do it.

```
let g:airline_section_z = '%{ViraStatusLine()}'
```
